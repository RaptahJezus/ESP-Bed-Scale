ESP Powered Bed Occupancy Sensor

Uses HX711 chip and 4 load cells 

[Load Cells + HX711](https://www.ebay.com/itm/4pcs-50KG-Body-Load-Cell-Resistance-Strain-Weight-Sensor-HX711-AD-Module/182899653153)


Note: Load cells require a bracket that supports the edge, while allowing the middle portion to deflect. Included is "half_bridge_load_sensor_holder-original.stl" which can be 3D printed. I used ABS plastic for mine and it works well.
